* Added gmail Authentication
* Added Queues

The Program consists of 4 API Implementation: 
## Authentication class: 
This class provides authentication functionality using Google Firebase. It has two methods:

`register_user(email: str)`: This method takes an email address as input, sends a verification email to the provided email address, and registers the user in the Firebase Authentication service.

`authenticate_user() -> str`: This method authenticates the user using Google Firebase Authentication. It prompts the user to enter a valid ID token and verifies it using the Firebase Authentication service. If the token is valid, it returns the email address of the authenticated user.

## FileUploader class: 
This class provides functionality for uploading and retrieving files from Google Drive using the Google Drive API. It has four methods:

`__init__(db_path: str):` This method creates a connection to the SQLite database located at db_path and creates a table for storing Google Drive credentials if it does not exist.

`upload_file(filename: str) -> Tuple[str, int]`: This method uploads a file to Database. It takes the filename of the file to upload as input and returns a tuple containing the response message and status code.

`retrieve_file(filename: str) -> str:` This method retrieves the contents of a file from the folder. It takes the filename of the file to retrieve as input and returns the contents of the file.


## TextNLP class: 
This class provides natural language processing functionality for analyzing text. It has four methods:

`__init__(db_path: str):` This method creates a connection to the SQLite database located at db_path and creates a table for storing text analysis results if it does not exist.

`analyze_text(text: str, analysis_type: str):` This method analyzes the provided text using the specified analysis_type (e.g. sentiment analysis) and stores the results in the database.

`process()`: This method processes the text analysis results and generates a list of results for each analysis type.

`get_results() -> List[str]`: This method returns the list of results generated by the process() method.

## NewsFeedAPI class: 
This class provides functionality for ingesting and retrieving news articles. It has three methods:

`__init__(db_path: str)`: This method creates a connection to the SQLite database located at db_path and creates a table for storing news articles if it does not exist.
`create_news_table()`: This method creates a table named "news_articles" in the SQLite database if it does not already exist. The table has the following columns:

id: An auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key of the table.
title: A string representing the title of the news article.
author: A string representing the author of the news article.
published_date: A string representing the date the news article was published.
content: A string representing the full text of the news article.

`ingest_articles(title, content, source: str)`: This method ingests news articles from a specified news API. It takes in 3 arguments:

title: A string representing title of the news.
content: A string representing content of the news.
source: A string representing the news source to ingest articles from.
The method ingests news articles from the specified news source and saves them to the "news_articles" table in the SQLite database.

`retrieve_feed(source: str)`: This method retrieves a specified number of news articles from the "news_articles" table in the SQLite database. It takes in one argument:

source: An integer representing the source of articles to retrieve.
The method returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single news article and has the following keys:

title: The title of the news article.
content: The full text of the news article.
source: The source of the news article.
